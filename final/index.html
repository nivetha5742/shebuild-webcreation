                    <h1>Mithali Raj-</h1>
                    <h5>Women's cricket</h5>
                    <p>India's greatest female batter, Mithali Raj, has reached milestones aplenty in her storied international career spanning more than two decades. The woman with most runs in the game, and the only Indian captain - male or female - to have led the side to two 50-over World Cup finals, the only major distinction that eludes the incumbent ODI captain is the tag of a World Cup winner. In pursuit of that dream, Raj bowed out of T20Is in September 2019, as India's highest run-scorer, having last led the side in the format during the 2016 T20 World Cup at home.

                        At 16, Raj scored an unbeaten 114 on ODI debut and soon established herself as the lynchpin of India's batting. The roots of her copybook stroke play lay in her precocious talent that blossomed under the tutelage of her former coach, the late Sampath Kumar, and a regimented upbringing in an army family. With a passion for Bharatanatyam, her nifty footwork found expression on the field, becoming as much a hallmark of her batting as have been grace and an unrivalled precision at plundering runs in the cover region.
                        
                        Her technical soundness and ability to anchor an innings at the top of the order in all three formats have inspired two generations of India batsmen. Both those skills underpinned her highest Test score of 214, in 2002, and later an unbeaten 91 in the 2005 ODI World Cup semi-final, a knock she rates at par with her double-century.
                        
                        During the 2017 ODI World Cup, Raj surpassed former England captain Charlotte Edwards to become the highest run-scorer in ODIs and the first woman to 6000 runs in the format. Her 409-run tally in the tournament was second only to England opener Tammy Beaumont's, while her three fifties and a century were vital to India's runners-up finish.
                        
                        In the 2018 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, Raj found herself embroiled in a controversy in the wake of her omission from the semi-final. She accused then head coach Ramesh Powar of unfair and discriminatory behaviour and expressed her disappointment over T20I captain Harmanpreet Kaur's decision to support her exclusion.
                        
                        In October 2019, Raj, at 36, became the first woman to complete two decades in ODI cricket. Annesha Ghosh

                    <h5>Ms.Knock-out</h5>
                    <p>Mangte Chungneijang Mary Kom OLY[2] (born 24th November 1982)[1] is an Indian amateur boxer, politician, and former Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha.[3][4][5] She is the only woman to win the World Amateur Boxing Championship six times, the only female boxer to have won a medal in each one of the first seven World Championships, and the only boxer (male or female) to win eight World Championship medals.[6][7][8][9] Nicknamed Magnificent Mary, she was the only Indian female boxer to have qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics, where she competed in the flyweight (51 kg) category and won a bronze medal.[10] She had also been ranked as the world's No. 1 female light-flyweight by the International Boxing Association (amateur) (AIBA).[11][12] She became the first Indian female boxer to win a gold medal in the Asian Games in 2014 at Incheon, South Korea and is the first Indian female boxer to win gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.[13] She is also the only boxer to become Asian Amateur Boxing Champion for a record six times.[14][15] Mary Kom won the 51kg gold in President's Cup in Indonesia.[16]

                        On 25 April 2016, the President of India nominated Kom as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament.[17] In March 2017, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, appointed Mary Kom along with Akhil Kumar as national observers for boxing.[18]
                        
                        After her sixth world title in 2018, the Government of Manipur has conferred on her the title "Meethoi Leima", loosely translated as great or exceptional lady in a felicitation ceremony held in Imphal on 11 December 2018. Mary Kom became the most successful boxer at world championships in 2019.[19] At the function, the then Chief Minister of Manipur also declared that the stretch of road leading to the National Games village in Imphal West district, where Kom currently resides, would be named as MC Mary Kom Road.[20][21] She was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, in 2020.[22][23]

                    <h5>Steffi Saina</h5>
                    <p>Saina Nehwal (pronunciation  (help·info); born 17 March 1990) is an Indian professional badminton player. A former world no. 1, she has won 24 international titles, which includes ten Superseries titles. Although she reached the world's 2nd in 2009, it was only in 2015 that she was able to attain the world no. 1 ranking, thereby becoming the only female player from India and therafter the second Indian player – after Prakash Padukone – to achieve this feat.[8] She has represented India three times in the Olympics, winning a bronze medal in her second appearance at London 2012.[9][10][11][12]

                        Nehwal has achieved several milestones in badminton for India. She is the only Indian to have won at least one medal in every BWF major individual event, namely the Olympics, the BWF World Championships, and the BWF World Junior Championships. She is the first Indian badminton player to have won an Olympic medal, the first Indian to have reached the final of the BWF World Championships, and the first Indian to have won the BWF World Junior Championships.[13] In 2006, Nehwal became the first Indian female and the youngest Asian to win a 4-star tournament. She is also the first Indian to win a Super Series title. In the 2014 Uber Cup, she captained the Indian team and remained undefeated, helping India to win a first-ever Uber Cup bronze medal.[14] Nehwal also became the first Indian to win two singles gold medals (2010 and 2018) at the Commonwealth Games.
                        
                        Considered one of India's most successful badminton players, Nehwal is credited for increasing the popularity of badminton in India.[15] In 2016, she was conferred the Padma Bhushan – India's third highest civilian award.[16] Previously, she had also received the nation's top two sporting honours, namely the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna and the Arjuna Award. Nehwal is a philanthropist and was ranked 18th on the list of most charitable athletes in 2015.[17].</p>
